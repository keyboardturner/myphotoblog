Hi, I do a little datamining for WoW, I make [various addons](https://keyboardturner.github.io/pages/some-addons.html), and I make 3d models / model edits and pose them for art. I hope to use this site one day to compile all my projects into one place.

Most images are self-hosted to reduce traffic upon github, but that also means they run the risk of being slow/unavailable sometimes. Eventually I may also have the entire website self-hosted as well and not on github, but for now this seems to work.

You can visit other links I have set up here: [https://keyboardturner.github.io/](https://keyboardturner.github.io/).
