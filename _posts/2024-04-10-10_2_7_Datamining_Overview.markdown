# 10.2.7 PTR Datamining


Just some neat things I found in 10.2.7 Datamining. These are mostly just models and the like, nothing much for story spoilers. Some of these things can be found in the new game mode called [WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24061007/under-development-wow-remix-mists-of-pandaria) (or Timerunning Pandamonium).

# Models

## Beach Chair

This particular beach chair seems to display peculiar LGBTQ+ rainbow and transgender pride flag colors on it. While the holiday is likely simply summer themed, there's a possibility it also doubles as a representation of LGBTQ+ Pride Month.

## Transmog Sets

While many of the questing armors remain specific to their armor type, some of the "starter sets" are in fact completely cosmetic across all armor proficiencies, including the Kor'kron Shaman sets, Shado-Pan Armors, and a few others. The "Partial" Helm / Shoulder / Belt combo sets still remain class-specific. There are currently about 400 new appearance item additions added to the collectable transmog data.
