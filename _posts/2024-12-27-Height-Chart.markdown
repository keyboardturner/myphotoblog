I sometimes struggle to find good resources for character heights in WoW, so some time back, I made a height chart. However, the only source is from my [twitter thread](https://x.com/keyboardturn/status/1643018909233340416), which I no longer use for obvious reasons. As such, I will be posting it here as a more permanent solution. In this post, I'll also have included data for the Earthen Dwarves, which if I recall were said to be approximately "25% larger than normal dwarves" (which is not actually the case in height, but was close). My original estimates based on this number back in January would have placed Male Earthen at about 2 inches taller than Female Human and 2 inches shorter than Male Human. Male Earthen stand at about 5 inches shorter than Female Human, and 9 inches shorter than Male Human.

Why do all this? As I said, partly as a personal RP resource for myself, but also sharing it in hopes that we might one day get a height slider option. It's one thing to implement a simple scale slider option, but it's another to figure out how far the slider should go.

## Fullsize Charts

Full-sized images. These are quite large, as they fit all playable races in.

### Fullsize Chart (T-Pose):

## Chart Pieces

These are split into "halves", generally to view them better on most screens.

# Disclaimers & Notes

Height Range data based upon [Human Height](https://ourworldindata.org/human-height) data and statistics provided by ourworldindata.org, and aims to match WoW human to real life human heights and general height distribution of healthy human adults. My data also further merges sexes, as it's effectively irrelevant and needlessly complicated in reference to WoW as the models are Body Types rather than necessarily Male / Female. Any references to "Male" or "Female" are colloquial terms for public viewers, however should not be taken as the true terms or to suggest Body 1 / Body 2 are explicitly Male / Female respectively.

The proper scale values were checked against ingame objects as well as [CreatureDisplayInfo.db2](https://wago.tools/db2/CreatureDisplayInfo) to ensure the models exported were their true ingame size. Ingame models (especially raid bosses) are often scaled larger for gameplay purposes. It's entirely possible that these values are incorrect to lore, but so far player models do appear to fall in line with recorded lore values.

Any values such as 5'12" should be taken as 6'0". It's a weird rounding error due to having to convert feet + inches separately. For better accuracy, refer to Centimeters. None of these values are "hardcoded" and instead use formulas calculated based upon the original recorded values of the model heights. This allows adding new values and changing existing measurements in case of future updates.

Bear in mind that WoW's ingame yards are actually meters. In reality, a human male is 2.02 meters (6'8") tall, not 2.02 yards. However, because the ingame tools state these are "yards", they will be recorded as such. Bear in mind these measurements are not in the correct units when it comes to porting models into other programs (possibly very important for something like VRChat or other 3d world spaces.)

The purpose of finding height range values is for reference in what would generally be seen as a "reasonable height range" in lore as well as potential future data reference to be used as a customization option. It would likely be an unreasonable option for a human to be a height of 8 feet tall or 3 feet tall (despite such real life extreme cases having been recorded historically before).

Most race options measure to the top of head or other main body part, rather than extraneous parts such as horns, tails, ears, and hair. A few exceptions include the Tauren and Worgen Body 1 Options, where measurement takes place on the peak of their back due to the inability to "shave" fur. Dracthyr measure at the top of their snout in their T-Pose, as their model aims their head upwards.

Some models such as Void Elf, Lightforged Draenei, Nightborne, and Highmountain Tauren were cut from the visual height charts because their models have identical height values. Their values were still recorded anyway just in case. Mag'har Orcs literally share the same source model (rather than a duplicated model like Lightforged Draenei) and are simply a texture swap. Their data is the Orc data.

Also yes, WoW's yards are actually meters. It's really weird. But since the *ingame measurement tools* are "yards", this is what I'm going with. Otherwise I would have gotten results like 6'8" humans.
